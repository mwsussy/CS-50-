# CS-50-
# Project Description
This is a C program that recreates a pyramid structure similar to the ones seen in Super Mario. The user is prompted to input the height of the pyramid (between 1 and 8), and the program prints a double-sided pyramid of that height.
# how It Works
The program uses loops and conditional statements.

Takes user input for the height.

Builds left and right aligned pyramids using # characters.

# Skills Used
C programming basics

Loops (for, while)

Conditionals (if, else)

Input validation
# How To Run

clang mario.c -o mario
./mario
Height: 4
